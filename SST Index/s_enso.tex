\section{An S-ENSO index for shifting warming patters}
We propose that the spatial distribution of Pacific Ocean warming might provide better predictive insights into the ENSO-Atlantic TC activity relationship than warming anomalies alone. We introduce the S-ENSO index that tracks the longitude of the warmest SST anomaly region between $6^\circ$ S - $36^\circ$ N and $90^\circ$ W - $140^\circ$ E. Monitoring the spatial distribution of warming has several advantages over traditional intensity-based indices that monitor a fixed region: First, it inherently accounts for any changes in ENSO's warming patters. Second, it is intimately related to the deep convection and associated distribution of the Walker circulation as a result of anomalous warming. Finally, unlike warming-based indices, it is robust to any temporal trends in the data.

The index is built by first averaging monthly SST anomalies over a certain month range and subsequently recording the location of the highest warming anomaly. Here we present the performance of the June-October S-ENSO index (see methods). We restrict our attention to satellite-era only data and this analysis spans data from 1979 until 2010. Table \ref{ref:lin_corr} shows S-ENSO's linear correlation coefficients with various quantities that summerize August-October Atlantic TC activity: number of tropical cyclones, number of major hurricanes, power dissipation index (PDI) \cite{emanuel2005a}, accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) \cite{Bell2000}, and net tropical cyclone energy (NTC) \cite{goldenberg2001}. The significant improvement over traditional static NINO indices, especially with regards to cumulative statistics such as ACE and NTC, indicates that S-ENSO resolves the large-scale conditions over the Atlantic as well as the in-season TC precursors more accurately than static warming-base indices.

In addition to providing better in-season accuracy than traditional NINO indices, S-ENSO is more robust to the ENSO spring predictability barrier \cite{webster1992}. Given that all ENSO indices, including S-ENSO, can be calculated for any month range we investigated each index' robustness to increasing lead times based on all possible month ranges up to a certain month (referred to here as lead month).
Figure \ref{fig:figures_monthly_cc_matix} shows the performance of S-ENSO as a function of months from which SST anomalies are averaged before building the index. When S-ENSO is built using Northern Hemisphere winter SSTs, its performance declines significantly. The performance gradually improves through the spring and summer months. 

Figure \ref{fig:figures_lead_time_bar} shows the performance of each NINO index as well as S-ENSO as a function of lead time.  S-ENSO is significantly more robust than traditional NINO indices to the Spring predictability barrier. Give the 30 degrees of freedom in the data (N=32; df = N-2), the traditional NINO indices do not provide significant correlations  (above 0.345) with Aug-Oct TCs until July, as opposed to March for S-ENSO. Furthermore, the improved accuracy remains significant from January until October. Therefore, if dynamical models can resolve the Pacific spatial warming patterns as represented by S-ENSO, then dynamical models could potentially have significant skill in predicting August-October TC activity.

%While S-ENSO's performance drops with January lead time, it is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than that of some static NINO indices.
