These bar graphs compare difference of PI composites for various months.  Each bar graph has a bas month, and then an end month which is always October.  For each category (Index, ENSO, or Hurricane Counts) you will see a number of bars, each bar corresponds to a startMonth-endMonth with the lowest start month always on the left most side.  Take March for example, the far left set of bars are for ENSO, and the leftmost bar in the ENSO section corresponds to March-March, then March-April, then March-May, etc.  The height of the bars is the AVERAGE of differnce in PI for a box with corrdinates lat:(5 20), lon:(-60 -15)
